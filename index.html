Kashmir is the paradise of tourists: Its scenic beauty and salubrious climate have given it the aptitude of “Tourists Paradise.” With its lakes and mountains, its luxurious chinars and tall slender poplars, delicious fruits ancient monuments, its placid rivers and murmuring streams swarming with Himalayan trout, and a host of innumerable natural attractions Kashmir, as G.T. Vigne prophesied in 1885, has become the sine qua non of the traveller to the East.

Kashmir is one of the most attractive tourist resorts in the world: It is a veritable paradise on earth. Beautiful as her mountains are during the day time they appear all the more beautiful and glorious at sunrise and sunset.

The valley of Kashmir has different attractions for different people: It is a pleasure garden for lovers, a playground for sportsmen, an ideal health resort for the sick and a haven of rest and repose for the worried and weary souls. To a poet, its enchanting sights and sounds are a source of joy and inspiration.
